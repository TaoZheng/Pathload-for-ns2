README FILE FOR PATHCHIRP NS-2 CODE
===================================

NOTE: <NS-2 DIR> refers to your ns-2.* directory, for example ns-2.26.

1) Adding code to ns-2

a) Save existing ns files that will be overwritten just in case you want to
  revert to original code.

cd <NS-2 DIR>
tar -cvf original.tar Makefile.in FILES tcl/lib/ns-default.tcl tcl/lib/ns-packet.tcl common/packet.h 

To revert to original:

cd <NS-2 DIR>
tar -xvf original.tar 
make clean
./configure
make depend
make


b) Untar pathChirp code

cd <NS-2 DIR>
tar -xvf pathChirp.tar
make clean
./configure
make depend
make


2) Running the example

The file ./pathChirp_tcl/pathChirp.tcl contains a simple 4 node example.
See the file for details about how to use pathChirp.

		0---------1---------2
		  1Gbps   |  10Mbps
			  |
			  | 1Gbps			
			  |
                          3
pathChirp runs from 0 to 2 and a CBR source between 3 and 2. The CBR (5Mbps)
source is on only from time 50s to 100s in the simulation.

On running

./ns ./pathChirp_tcl/pathChirp.tcl > av_bw.out

we get the pathChirp available bandwidth information in av_bw.out.
The data format is

<time stamp> <available bandwidth(Mbps)>

To test if the output is as expected:

diff av_bw.out av_bw_expected.out
